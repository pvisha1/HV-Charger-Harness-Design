⚡ High Voltage Wiring Harness Routing – CATIA V5 Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and routing a High Voltage (HV) wiring harness for an automotive platform using CATIA V5 Electrical Harness Design workbench.
The routing is created based on realistic engineering constraints such as bend radius, clipping strategy, clearance zones, and HV safety rules.

The harness is modeled on a simplified BIW with major components such as:

HV Battery Pack

Power Distribution Unit (PDU)

Inverter / Motor Controller

Body Structures (floor, pillars, side panels)

---

🎯 Objectives

Design an HV harness routing path compliant with industry standards (ISO 19642, LV214, USCAR-2).

Maintain minimum HV safety clearance, separation and mechanical protection.

Proper placement of clips, clamps, supports, and grommets along BIW.

Create a clean and manufacturable multi-branchable structure.

Verify serviceability, accessibility, and ergonomic feasibility.
